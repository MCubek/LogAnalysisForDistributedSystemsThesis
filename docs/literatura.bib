	abstract = {Every enterprise application creates data, whether it consists of log messages, metrics, user activity, or outgoing messages. Moving all this data is just as important as the data itself. With this updated edition, application architects, developers, and production engineers new to the Kafka streaming platform will learn how to handle data in motion. Additional chapters cover Kafka's AdminClient API, transactions, new security features, and tooling changes.Engineers from Confluent and LinkedIn responsible for developing Kafka explain how to deploy production Kafka clusters, write reliable event-driven microservices, and build scalable stream processing applications with this platform. Through detailed examples, you'll learn Kafka's design principles, reliability guarantees, key APIs, and architecture details, including the replication protocol, the controller, and the storage layer.You'll examine:Best practices for deploying and configuring KafkaKafka producers and consumers for writing and reading messagesPatterns and use-case requirements to ensure reliable data deliveryBest practices for building data pipelines and applications with KafkaHow to perform monitoring, tuning, and maintenance tasks with Kafka in productionThe most critical metrics among Kafka's operational measurementsKafka's delivery capabilities for stream processing systems},

	abstract = {Working with unbounded and fast-moving data streams has historically been difficult. But with Kafka Streams and ksqlDB, building stream processing applications is easy and fun. This practical guide shows data engineers how to use these tools to build highly scalable stream processing applications for moving, enriching, and transforming large amounts of data in real time.Mitch Seymour, data services engineer at Mailchimp, explains important stream processing concepts against a backdrop of several interesting business problems. You'll learn the strengths of both Kafka Streams and ksqlDB to help you choose the best tool for each unique stream processing project. Non-Java developers will find the ksqlDB path to be an especially gentle introduction to stream processing.Learn the basics of Kafka and the pub/sub communication patternBuild stateless and stateful stream processing applications using Kafka Streams and ksqlDBPerform advanced stateful operations, including windowed joins and aggregationsUnderstand how stateful processing works under the hoodLearn about ksqlDB's data integration features, powered by Kafka ConnectWork with different types of collections in ksqlDB and perform push and pull queriesDeploy your Kafka Streams and ksqlDB applications to production},

Since ZooKeeper is part of critical infrastructure, ZooKeeper aims to provide a simple and high performance kernel for building more complex coordination primitives at the client. It incorporates elements from group messaging, shared registers, and distributed lock services in a replicated, centralized service. The interface exposed by ZooKeeper has the wait-free aspects of shared registers with an event-driven mechanism similar to cache invalidations of distributed ﬁle systems to provide a simple, yet powerful coordination service.},
